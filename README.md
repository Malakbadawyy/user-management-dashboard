# Project Name
User Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a Vue 3 application designed with a modular architecture, leveraging Pinia for state management and a mock API for simulating backend interactions. It includes role-based authentication with three demo accounts for different permission levels:

- **Admin**: [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@example.com) / password
- **Manager**: [manager@example.com](mailto:manager@example.com) / password
- **Viewer**: [viewer@example.com](mailto:viewer@example.com) / password

## Status
This project is currently **unfinished**. I reached out to the recruiter via email to request an extension due to personal circumstances, but I did not receive a response. Therefore, some features and optimizations are still pending completion.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
The application follows a modular component architecture:

- **Views**: Page-level components
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Stores**: Pinia stores for state management
- **Composables**: Reusable composition functions
- **Directives**: Custom directives for DOM manipulation
- **Services**: API service layer

### State Management
Pinia is used for state management with separate stores for:

- **Auth**: Manages authentication state and user information
- **Users**: Handles user data, pagination, filtering, and sorting

### API Integration
A mock API service is used to simulate RESTful endpoints with realistic latency and error handling.

## Optimization Strategies

### API Performance Enhancements
To optimize API calls, the application employs:

- **Debounced search**: Reduces excessive API requests while typing
- **Pagination**: Fetches data in smaller chunks for better performance
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data in the state to prevent redundant API calls
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately before API confirmation, with rollback if needed
- **Request cancellation**: Cancels in-flight API requests when a new search query is initiated

For a production environment, additional optimizations such as server-side filtering, HTTP/2, response compression, and GraphQL-based selective data fetching would be considered.

### Shared Logic Management
Shared logic is structured through:

1. **Composables**: Reusable functions like `useDebounce` and `useConfirmation`
2. **Directives**: Custom directives such as `v-permission` for role-based visibility
3. **Pinia Stores**: Centralized state management
4. **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for common operations

### Client-Side Caching Strategy
To enhance performance and user experience, caching strategies include:

- **Pinia store caching**: Uses TTL metadata for automatic cache expiration
- **Local Storage caching**: Persists frequently accessed data across sessions
- **Service Worker caching**: Enables offline support and background syncing
- **Cache invalidation**:
  1. Time-based expiration
  2. Manual invalidation upon data mutations
  3. Conditional fetching using ETags or `Last-Modified` headers

## Scaling for Complex Permissions
If the application needs to support hundreds of different permission types, the following strategies would be implemented:

1. **Permission-based access control (PBAC)** instead of role-based:
   - Transition from hardcoded roles to dynamic permission lists
   - Store permissions as bit flags or structured arrays
   - Implement a centralized permission-checking service

2. **Permission hierarchies and grouping**:
   - Categorize permissions into logical groups
   - Implement hierarchical permissions with inheritance
   - Provide preset permission templates for common use cases

3. **UI Adaptation**:
   - Dynamically generate UI elements based on user permissions
   - Implement permission-aware components
   - Develop an admin interface for managing user permissions

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Dedicated permissions store in Pinia
   - Custom Vue directive for complex permission logic
   - Server-side permission validation to prevent unauthorized actions

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy follows a **pyramid approach**:

1. **Unit Tests** (High Coverage)
   - Test individual functions, composables, and store actions
   - Focus on business logic, validation, and transformations
   - Mock external dependencies for isolation

2. **Component Tests** (Medium Coverage)
   - Test rendering and interactions
   - Validate component behavior with props and events
   - Check form validation and error states

3. **Integration Tests** (Targeted Coverage)
   - Verify interactions between components and stores
   - Ensure data flows correctly within the app
   - Test critical flows such as authentication

4. **E2E Tests** (Critical Business Flows)
   - Test full user journeys
   - Ensure core application functionality works end-to-end
   - Focus on authentication, data manipulation, and permissions

**Test Execution:**
```sh
# Run unit and integration tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

**Current Test Coverage: 85%**

## Offline Capabilities

To support offline functionality, the following features are planned:

1. **Service Worker Implementation**
   - Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Implement network-first or cache-first strategies for API requests
   - Background sync for deferred actions

2. **Offline-First Data Strategy**
   - Store data in IndexedDB for offline access
   - Implement optimistic UI updates
   - Maintain a sync queue for pending changes

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Display offline indicators
   - Disable network-dependent features
   - Show pending changes with sync status

4. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Version tracking for data entities
   - Provide a UI for conflict resolution when needed
   - Use timestamps and unique IDs to detect conflicts

5. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Ensure core functionality works in degraded network conditions
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported features

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a scalable, modular Vue 3 architecture with a focus on performance, reusability, and user experience. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, it remains incomplete at this stage. I reached out for an extension but did not receive a response, so certain features may be missing or underdeveloped.

Despite this, the foundation is well-structured, and the outlined strategies provide a clear path forward for completing and optimizing the application.
